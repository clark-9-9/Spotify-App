'Authorization': 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(client_id + ':' + client_secret).toString('base64'),
here why did u use basic instead Bearer is there difference

Yes, there is a difference between using `Basic` and `Bearer` in the `Authorization` header, and it depends on the context of the authentication.

1. **Basic Authentication (`Basic`):**
   - When you use `Basic` in the `Authorization` header, you are sending your client credentials (client ID and client secret) as a Base64-encoded string. This is typically used for the initial authentication step when obtaining an access token using the Client Credentials Flow.
   - The format of `Basic` authentication is: `'Basic ' + Base64(client_id:client_secret)`

2. **Bearer Authentication (`Bearer`):**
   - When you use `Bearer` in the `Authorization` header, you are sending an already obtained access token for authentication. This token is used to grant access to specific resources on behalf of a user or application.
   - The format of `Bearer` authentication is: `'Bearer ' + access_token`

In the context of the code snippet you provided, you use `Basic` authentication to obtain an access token using the Client Credentials Flow. This involves sending your client credentials (client ID and client secret) as a Base64-encoded string in the `Authorization` header. This initial step is necessary to authenticate your app and obtain the access token that will be used later for actual API requests.

Once you have the access token, you'll use `Bearer` authentication to include the token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent API requests. This tells the API that the request is authorized on behalf of the user or application associated with the access token.

So, the use of `Basic` and `Bearer` authentication depends on the specific stage of authentication you're in: obtaining an access token (`Basic`) and using the obtained access token to access resources (`Bearer`).
