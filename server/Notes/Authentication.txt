If you're looking to learn more about authentication and authorization concepts, including terms like Bearer, Basic, and OAuth, you can start by searching for resources related to "web authentication" and "OAuth 2.0." Here are some keywords and topics to explore:

1. **OAuth 2.0:** OAuth is a widely used protocol for authorization. It allows applications to access resources on behalf of a user without exposing their credentials. Look for tutorials, guides, and documentation that explain the OAuth 2.0 flow, authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, and scopes.

2. **Bearer Authentication:** This is a simple form of token-based authentication commonly used with OAuth 2.0. Search for explanations of how bearer tokens work and how they're used in securing API requests.

3. **Basic Authentication:** Basic Auth is a simple authentication mechanism where the client sends a username and password as part of the request headers. It's less secure compared to OAuth, but it's still used in some cases. Look for explanations on how Basic Auth works, how to encode credentials, and its pros and cons.

4. **Token-Based Authentication:** Learn about the concept of using tokens (like access tokens and refresh tokens) to authenticate and authorize requests. Explore how tokens are generated, validated, and used to access protected resources.

5. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** JWT is a type of token used for securely transmitting information between parties. Search for resources that explain JWT structure, creation, verification, and best practices.

6. **OAuth Providers and Libraries:** Search for OAuth libraries and providers in your programming language or framework of choice. These libraries can help you implement OAuth 2.0 and other authentication mechanisms easily.

7. **Authentication vs. Authorization:** Understand the difference between authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (determining what actions a user is allowed to perform).

8. **Secure API Design:** Explore best practices for designing secure APIs, including authentication and authorization strategies.

9. **OpenID Connect:** This is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. It adds an authentication layer, allowing you to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.

10. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Learn about additional layers of security that involve more than just a username and password, such as using a mobile app to provide a second verification step.

When learning about these concepts, be sure to refer to reputable sources such as official documentation, tutorials from established technology companies, and trusted online learning platforms. These topics are fundamental to understanding how authentication and authorization work in modern web applications and APIs.
