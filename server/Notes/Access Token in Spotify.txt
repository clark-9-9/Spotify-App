Access Token
The access token is a string which contains the credentials and permissions that can be used to access a given resource (e.g artists, albums or tracks) or user's data (e.g your profile or your playlists).

To use the access token you must include the following header in your API calls:

HEADER PARAMETER	VALUE
Authorization	Required Valid access token following the format: Bearer <Access Token>
The following example uses cURL to retrieve information about a track using the Get a track endpoint:

curl --request GET \
    'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2TpxZ7JUBn3uw46aR7qd6V' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer NgCXRK...MzYjw"
     
Note that the access token is valid for 1 hour (3600 seconds). After that time, the token expires and you need to request a new one.
