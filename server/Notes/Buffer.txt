what is Buffer here is it built in node js

Yes, Buffer is a built-in Node.js class that provides a way to work with binary data, such as reading from or writing to streams, handling binary data in file systems, and other low-level operations. It's commonly used for handling binary data, like encoding and decoding binary data, images, files, etc.
In the context you provided earlier:

'Authorization': 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(CLIENT_ID + ':' + CLIENT_SECRET).toString('base64'),

Buffer.from() is used to convert the concatenation of CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET into a buffer, and then toString('base64') encodes the buffer in Base64. This is a common way to encode the client credentials for Basic authentication when making API requests.
In modern JavaScript, especially when running in a browser environment, you might also use other methods like btoa() for Base64 encoding and fetch() for making network requests. However, in a Node.js environment, using Buffer for these operations is a common practice.
